This repo is used to store my dotfiles.

## Get start

If you are tired of configuring all kinds of software,
you can use my configuration file and follow the following steps.

+ ``git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/aj-ash/dotfiles``
+ According to their own needs to modify ``dotfiles/files/Restore-List.md`` file
+ ``cd dotfiles/tools``
+ ``bash Restore.sh``
+ ~~``rm -rf ../../dotfiles``~~

**Note:**

The configuration file may not have the configuration of the software you need,
and the configuration file may be more in line with my usage habits.
